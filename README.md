sample code - java data manipulation/transfer

This is a sample set of code that I have worked on that has been in production.  This is a minimized version with not all the rulesets from the
original but I have added a few flow diagrams for the usecase of this program.

The main usecase is to generate a file to send to a destination based on data pre-existing in a SQL database.
